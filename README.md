# Music Practice Tracking (Working Title)
The following readme is the project summary I'm working from to get this project working (generated by Claude). The context is that I'm a musician who plays multiple instruments and I often find it hard to keep track of what I was working on the last time I played. I often find myself being aimless and not knowing where to pick up or what to improve on next. Furthermore, I find it difficult if I'm trying to understand a concept on where I can find that information which takes up valuable practice time. I'm hoping that using this project can help me organise my throughts which might help me to become not only a better programmer but also a better musician at the same time.

## Project Overview
